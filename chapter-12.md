Buffer/Window/Tab Management
============================
Although I covered a few simpler commands and topics than in some of the earlier chapters, I want you, the faithful reader, to realize the importance of what I’ve discussed here. These concepts and techniques are fundamental to your use of Vim and are extremely useful, once committed to memory. Following is a quick recap of what we’ve covered:
• I started by explaining why it’s important to learn the raw commands, such as making you much more comfortable within an environment in which your own configurations are not available, as well as ensuring that you’re more efficient at controlling complex layouts that evolve over time.
• We looked at the different ways of managing lots of buffers and you learned some interesting commands, such as how to split multiple buffers into individual windows (using :sba), and a wide range of options for closing multiple buffers at once, using ranges and wildcard globbing patterns and the :bufdo command.
• We moved on to how best to manage the problem of an evolving working environment that resulted in many different windows of varying dimensions being opened and how you could take back control, by manipulating the window sizes, closing multiple windows at once, creating new split windows, and changing the layout of existing windows.
• Finally, we looked at how tabs work—how to create and close them and move separate windows into new tabs. You also learned how to rearrange an existing set of tabs, so that they are more appropriately ordered.

虽然我介绍了一些比前面几章更简单的命令和主题，但我希望你，忠实的读者，认识到我在这里讨论过的重要性。这些概念和技术是您使用Vim的基础，一旦提交到内存，它们就非常有用。以下是我们所涵盖内容的快速回顾：
•我首先解释了为什么学习原始命令很重要，例如在您自己的配置不可用的环境中让您更舒服，以及确保您更有效地控制复杂的布局。时间。
•我们研究了管理大量缓冲区的不同方法，并了解了一些有趣的命令，例如如何将多个缓冲区拆分为单个窗口（使用：sba），以及使用范围一次性关闭多个缓冲区的多种选项和wildcard globbing模式以及：bufdo命令。
•我们继续探讨如何最好地管理不断变化的工作环境问题，导致打开不同尺寸的许多不同窗口，以及如何通过操纵窗口大小，一次关闭多个窗口，创建新的拆分来取回控制权窗口，并更改现有窗口的布局。
•最后，我们查看了标签的工作原理 - 如何创建和关闭它们以及将单独的窗口移动到新标签中。您还学习了如何重新排列现有选项卡集，以便更有效地排序。
