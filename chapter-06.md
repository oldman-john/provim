Registers
====================
So, this wasn’t a particularly long chapter; but that’s because, although we were focusing on a core feature of Vim (that still confuses even long-term Vim users), there isn’t really that much to it, when you start digging around. Let’s, however, just quickly recap what we have learned, before we move on.
• We took a quick top-level look at the different types of registers and what their identifiers are.
• You learned that we can always access the register’s content, either by running :reg or by
checking the content of a local ~/.viminfo file.
• You learned how to access specific registers, so we can do something with their content
(mostly paste that content somewhere else).
• We went through and studied each of the nine registers and what their purposes are.
• Finally, we looked at a way we could clear all the content from our registers, using a bit of VimL.
==============
所以，这不是一个特别长的章节;但那是因为，虽然我们专注于Vim的核心功能（即使是长期的Vim用户仍然感到困惑），但当你开始挖掘时，它并没有那么多。但是，在我们继续前进之前，让我们快速回顾一下我们学到的东西。
•我们快速了解了不同类型的寄存器以及它们的标识符。
•您了解到我们始终可以通过运行：reg或by来访问寄存器的内容
检查本地〜/ .viminfo文件的内容。
•您学习了如何访问特定寄存器，因此我们可以对其内容执行某些操作
（主要是将内容粘贴到其他地方）。
•我们仔细研究了九个寄存器中的每一个以及它们的用途。
•最后，我们研究了一种方法，我们可以使用一些VimL清除寄存器中的所有内容。
