Files
=======
Although I might not have delved too deeply into some of the file features available within Vim, I have covered a lot of important topics. Let’s quickly recap some of them.
• We looked at how to open files from outside Vim, using globs/wildcards, and how to manipulate the :e command within Vim, using certain keyboard shortcuts.
• I discussed how Vim handles certain file formats across different operating systems and how to dynamically change those values by resetting the fileformat option.
• We saw how to inject content both manually and dynamically (by combining the read command with the ! command), which provides very powerful tools to construct data on the fly for us to manipulate within Vim.
• We looked at how to navigate Vim’s open buffers. You’ll use these commands a lot, and so it’s crucial that you start learning about them now.
• You learned the many ways to create and write files (including splitting them into different window splits and tabs, as well as dynamically loading boilerplate skeleton templates based on the type of file you’re creating).
• We saw how to create scratch buffers to quickly and efficiently create content deemed to be completely deposable and, more important, secure it from being stored accidentally by swapfiles or backup processes.
• Finally, we looked at Vim’s powerful file name modifiers feature and different examples of how we might want to utilize it.
